**What is Docker?**

'Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that can run applications and their dependencies in isolation. Docker provides a way to package and distribute applications with their entire runtime environment, making it easy to deploy applications consistently across different environments.'

Here are some key concepts and commands related to Docker:

1. **"Images":** Docker images are the building blocks used to create containers. An image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

To pull an image from Docker Hub: docker pull image_name
To list local images: docker images

2. **"Containers":** Containers are instances of Docker images. They run applications in isolated environments and can communicate with each other and the host system.

To run a container: docker run image_name
To list running containers: docker ps
To list all containers (including stopped ones): docker ps -a
Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a script containing instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image, sets up the environment, copies files, and defines other configuration settings.

3. **"Volumes":** Volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. They allow data to survive container restarts and can be shared between containers.

To create a volume: docker volume create volume_name
To mount a volume when running a container: docker run -v volume_name:/path/in/container

4. **"Networking":** Docker provides a variety of networking options to allow containers to communicate with each other and the outside world.

To expose a port when running a container:docker run -p host_port:container_port
To create a custom network: docker network create network_name

5. **"Compose":** Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure the application's services, networks, and volumes.

To start containers defined in a
docker-compose.yml
file: docker-compose up
To stop and remove containers defined in a
docker-compose.yml
file: docker-compose down
These are just a few basics to get you started with Docker. Depending on your use case, you may need to explore more advanced features and configurations.
