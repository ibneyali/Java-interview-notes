SOLID principles are five fundamental design principles in object-oriented programming that promote clean, maintainable, and flexible code.

"Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)"

Let’s explain each principle in detail:

"Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)": This principle states that every Java class must perform a single functionality. Implementation of multiple functionalities in a single class can make the code complex and if any modification is required, it may affect the whole class. It ensures that the code is precise and can be easily maintained .

"Open-Closed Principle (OCP)": This principle states that according to new requirements, the module should be open for extension but closed for modification. The extension allows us to implement new functionality to the module .

"Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)": This principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program .

"Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)": This principle states that a client should not be forced to implement an interface that it does not use. Instead of one large interface, it is better to have multiple smaller interfaces .

"Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)": This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions
