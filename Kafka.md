What is kafka?

Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform. It is designed for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

Key features of Apache Kafka include:

"Distributed Messaging System": Kafka provides a distributed and fault-tolerant messaging system that allows you to publish and subscribe to streams of records.

"Event Streaming Platform": It is often used as a platform for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications, enabling the processing of data in real-time.

"High Throughput": Kafka is capable of handling a large number of events or messages per second, making it suitable for high-throughput applications.

"Fault Tolerance": Kafka is designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant. It replicates data across multiple brokers to ensure data durability and prevent data loss in case of failures.

"Scalability": Kafka is scalable both horizontally (by adding more brokers) and vertically (by increasing resources on existing brokers), allowing it to handle growing workloads.

"Durability": Data in Kafka is persisted on disk, providing durability even in the face of broker failures.

"Stream Processing": Kafka supports stream processing, allowing you to build real-time applications that process and analyze data as it flows through the system.

Kafka is widely used in various industries for different use cases such as log aggregation, event sourcing, monitoring, data integration, and building scalable and fault-tolerant real-time data applications. It has become a popular choice for organizations dealing with large
