"question1:" What is the internal working of Spring Boot?
Spring Boot, despite its simplified development experience, has a well-defined internal workflow. Here is a breakdown of its key workings:

1. Application Startup:

It starts with a typical main method, often named run, using SpringApplication.run(). This method triggers the creation of the application context, the heart of Spring.

2. Context Creation and Configuration:

Spring Boot uses annotation-based configuration, searching for classes annotated with @Configuration. These classes define beans (manageable objects) and other application configurations. The chosen WebApplicationContext type (e.g., AnnotationConfigServletWebServerApplicationContext) is created based on the application type (web or reactive).

3. Auto-configuration:

Spring Boot is known for its extensive auto-configuration capabilities.
It scans the classpath for dependencies and automatically configures beans based on their presence.
This eliminates the need for manual configuration in many cases, simplifying development.

4. Bean Creation and Management:

Spring Boot creates and manages beans based on their definitions and dependencies. It injects dependencies between beans using dependency injection, following the Inversion of Control (IoC) principle. This allows for loose coupling and easier testing.

5. Embedded Server:

Spring Boot comes with embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow by default. You can choose the server during application creation or configuration. This eliminates the need for a separate server installation, streamlining deployment.

6. Request Handling:

When an HTTP request arrives, Spring Boot iss dispatcher servlet routes it to the appropriate controller based on the request path.
The controller handles the request, interacts with other beans (e.g., services, repositories) as needed, and generates a response.

7. Additional Features:

Spring Boot offers various other features out of the box, such as:

Security configuration
Actuator endpoints for monitoring and management
Integration with databases and other external resources
Understanding these internal workings provides a deeper insight into how Spring Boot simplifies Java application development while maintaining a robust and efficient architecture.



"question2:" Difference between deep copy  and shallow copy??
Deep copy and shallow copy are two approaches for copying objects in programming. They differ in how they handle the underlying data and references:

Shallow Copy:

Creates a new object with the same values as the original object for primitive data types (e.g., integers, strings) stored within.
However, for references (pointers to other objects), it copies the memory addresses instead of creating new copies of the referenced objects themselves.
This means any changes made to the copied object will also be reflected in the original object, as they both share the same underlying data.

Advantages:
Faster execution due to less data copying.
Memory-efficient for simple data structures.
Disadvantages:
Changes in the copy affect the original.
Not suitable for complex data structures with nested objects.

Deep Copy:

Creates a completely independent copy of the original object.
It copies the values of primitive data types and recursively creates new copies of any referenced objects the original object points to.
Any changes made to the copied object will not affect the original object or its referenced objects.
Advantages:
Modifications to the copy are isolated from the original.
Suitable for complex data structures with nested objects.
Disadvantages:
Slower execution due to potentially extensive data copying.
More memory consumption compared to shallow copy.
Here is an analogy:

Shallow copy: Imagine photocopying a document. The copy has the same text, but it is still connected to the original document. If you modify the copy (e.g., highlight something), the original document is also modified.
Deep copy: Imagine retyping the entire document to create a new one. The new document has the same content but is completely independent. Changes to the new document wont affect the original.
Choosing between shallow and deep copy depends on your specific needs. If you only need a new reference with the same values and dont mind modifications affecting the original, shallow copy might be sufficient. However, for independent copies and complex data structures, deep copy is the recommended approach.


"question3:" Difference between pass by reference and pass by value?
Pass by reference and pass by value are two different mechanisms for how arguments are passed to functions in programming languages. They differ in how the function accesses and potentially modifies the data:

Pass by Value:

When a variable is passed by value, the function receives a copy of the original variables value.
Any changes made to the copy within the function do not affect the original variable in the calling code.
This is because the function operates on a separate copy of the data, isolated from the original.
This approach is typically used for primitive data types (e.g., integers, strings) where copying the value is straightforward and efficient.
Pass by Reference:

When a variable is passed by reference, the function receives a reference (memory address) to the original variable in memory.
This means the function and the calling code are essentially working with the same piece of memory.
Any changes made to the variable within the function will also be reflected in the original variable in the calling code, as they both point to the same memory location.
This approach is commonly used for complex data structures (e.g., objects, arrays) where copying the entire data structure can be expensive or unnecessary.
Here is an analogy:

Pass by value: Imagine giving someone a photocopy of a map. They can draw on the copy, but it wont affect the original map you still hold.
Pass by reference: Imagine giving someone a map and highlighting a route together. Any markings they make on the map will also be visible on your copy, as youre both looking at the same map.
Choosing between pass by value and pass by reference depends on several factors:

Type of data: For primitive data types, pass by value is common due to efficiency. For complex data structures, pass by reference might be preferred to avoid unnecessary copying.
Intended behavior: If you need to modify the original data from within the function, pass by reference is necessary. If you only need to work with a copy without affecting the original, pass by value can be appropriate.
It is important to understand the concept of pass by value and pass by reference to write predictable and maintainable code, especially when working with complex data structures and function interactions.

question4: How to write a deep copy program using java?
There are several ways to achieve deep copy in Java, each with its own advantages and considerations:

1. Copy Constructor:

Define a constructor that takes the object to be copied as an argument.
Within the constructor, create new instances of the referenced objects recursively for nested objects.
Assign the newly created object references to the corresponding fields in the new object.
Java
public class MyClass {
    private int primitiveData;
    private MyNestedClass nestedObject;

    public MyClass(int primitiveData, MyNestedClass nestedObject) {
        this.primitiveData = primitiveData;
        this.nestedObject = new MyNestedClass(nestedObject.getValue()); // Deep copy of nested object
    }

    // ... other methods
}
Use code with caution.
2. Serialization and Deserialization:

Implement the Serializable interface in your class.
Use an object serialization library like java.io to write the object state to a byte stream.
Read the byte stream to deserialize it and create a new object with the same state.
Java
public class MyClass implements Serializable {
    private int primitiveData;
    private MyNestedClass nestedObject;

    // ... other methods and constructor

    public MyClass deepCopy() throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(baos);
        oos.writeObject(this);

        ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(baos.toByteArray());
        ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(bais);
        return (MyClass) ois.readObject();
    }
}
Use code with caution.
3. Reflection:

Use reflection to access the fields of the object and create new instances with the same values.
This approach can be complex and less efficient compared to other methods.
Choosing the best method depends on your specific needs:

Copy constructor and other custom methods: Offer fine-grained control over the copying process and can be optimized for specific data structures.
Serialization: Straightforward for general-purpose deep copying but can be slower and less memory-efficient for very large objects.
Reflection: Least preferred due to complexity and potential performance overhead.
Remember that deep copying can be resource-intensive, so consider its necessity carefully and choose the approach that best balances your requirements for functionality and performance.


"question5:" What is string pool and internal working?

The string pool is a memory optimization technique used in Java to improve performance and memory efficiency. Here is how it works:

Concept and Purpose:

The string pool is a special area in the Java heap memory that stores unique string literals (fixed text values directly written in code).
When you create a string literal in your program, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) first checks the string pool to see if an identical string already exists.
If the string exists in the pool, the JVM simply reuses the existing object reference instead of creating a new one.
Benefits:

Reduced memory usage: By reusing existing strings, the string pool avoids unnecessary object creation, saving memory space.
Improved performance: Since object creation can be a relatively slow operation, reusing existing objects leads to faster program execution.
Internal Working:

String Creation: When you create a string literal using double quotes (e.g., "Hello"), the following happens:

The JVM first checks the string pool.
If the exact string already exists (case-sensitive and character-by-character comparison), the reference to the existing object is returned.
If the string doesnt exist, a new String object is created and added to the pool.
String Interning: The intern() method allows you to explicitly add a string to the pool:

Calling myString.intern() will cause the JVM to:
Check the pool for the same string.
If it exists, return the existing object reference.
If not, add the string to the pool and return its reference.
Important Points:

The string pool is generally not accessible directly from your program.
The string pool is not thread-safe, so be cautious when using it in multithreaded environments.
Not all strings are stored in the pool. For example, strings created dynamically using the new String() constructor are not automatically added to the pool.
Understanding the string pool and its internal working can help you write more efficient and memory-conscious Java programs.
