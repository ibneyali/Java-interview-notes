In Java 8, the `Comparable` and `Comparator` interfaces are used to sort objects. The `Comparable` interface is used to define the natural order of an object, while the `Comparator` interface is used to define a custom order for an object.

1. **Comparable**: The `Comparable` interface is used to define the natural order of an object. It contains only one method, `compareTo()`, which compares the current object with another object of the same type. Here is an example of how to use `Comparable` to sort a list of strings in ascending order:

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Mike", "David", "Alice");
Collections.sort(names);
```

2. **Comparator**: The `Comparator` interface is used to define a custom order for an object. It contains two methods, `compare()` and `equals()`. Here is an example of how to use `Comparator` to sort a list of strings in descending order:

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Mike", "David", "Alice");
Comparator<String> descendingOrder = (a, b) -> b.compareTo(a);
Collections.sort(names, descendingOrder);
```

Alternatively, you can use the `Comparator.reverseOrder()` method to sort a list of strings in descending order:

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Mike", "David", "Alice");
Collections.sort(names, Comparator.reverseOrder());
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
